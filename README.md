# EEG-Based Sleep Stage Classification Neural Network

This repository presents the final implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for accurate sleep stage classification using EEG signals from the F3 and F4 channels. The model employs advanced deep learning techniques to optimize wake-up times and reduce sleep inertia by identifying sleep stages in real-time.

## Features and Architecture

- **Dual-Channel Input**: Processes EEG signals from the F3 and F4 channels through parallel convolutional branches to enhance spatial feature extraction.
- **Architecture Highlights**:
  - **Convolutional Layers**: Sequential Conv1D layers (64 to 1024 filters) with Batch Normalization and LeakyReLU activations for hierarchical feature learning.
  - **Global Max Pooling**: Retains the most prominent activations for each feature map, reducing dimensionality.
  - **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with 768 and 384 units, Batch Normalization, LeakyReLU activations, and Dropout (0.4) for improved generalization.
  - **Softmax Output Layer**: Generates a probability distribution over five sleep stages (Wake, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3, REM).

## Results and Performance

- **Accuracy**:
  - Achieved **92.4% for Wake**, **95.2% for NREM3**, and **89% for REM** classification, demonstrating strong performance across key sleep stages.
  - An average F1-score of over **0.90**, reflecting balanced precision and recall across all classes.
- **Model Robustness**: The confusion matrix reveals minimal misclassifications, particularly in adjacent sleep stages, underscoring the modelâ€™s reliability.
