This repository contains a CNN for EEG-based sleep stage classification using F3 and F4 channels. It employs convolutional layers, global max pooling, and dense layers with dropout. The model predicts five sleep stages via a softmax layer and is built with TensorFlow/Keras, designed for sleep optimization and research applications.
